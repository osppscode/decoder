This app encodes and decodes messages using binary and 32-level digital.

It is designed to be used as part of the Digital Signals unit, created for St. Paul Public Schools by Diego Rojas and Joe Kremer with BSCS. The app was designed and coded by Joe Kremer.

The 32-Level encoding assigns values 1-32 to each allowed character. The binary digital encoding assigns a unique 7-bit code to each character, consistent by ASCII encoding.
